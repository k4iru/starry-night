## Lessons Learned

As my first full-stack application there was a lot of learning involved. However, I believe that the biggest challenge I had was actually deploying my product. Getting everything to work individually took some time, but deploying it and having everything working properly was super frustrating at the start. A lot of guides I tried to follow didn't fit exactly, this led to a lot of research to really learn how the backend, frontend, and web server interact. Another struggle I had was figuring out how to list all the Dark Sky Reserves I wanted. One choice was using googles api, however that would allow users to get astroweather data for any location. I decided instead to limit user options by enumerating a list of all the Dark Sky Reserves in Canda that users can pick from instead.
