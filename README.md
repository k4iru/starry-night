## Lessons Learned

As my first full-stack application there was a lot of learning involved. However, I believe that the biggest challenge I had was actually deploying my product. Getting everything to work individually took some time, but deploying it and having everything working properly was super frustrating at the start. A lot of guides I tried to follow didn't fit exactly, this led to a lot of research to really learn how the backend, frontend, and webserver interact.
